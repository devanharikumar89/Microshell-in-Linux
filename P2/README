README for ush parser. 

Vincent W. Freeh
=====================

This a parser for a csh-like syntax.  It is to be used for the ush
shell project.

There are five files:

 . README	this file
 . Makefile	
 . main.c	driver program that reads and prints commands
 . parse.c	define parsing function and other support functions
 . parse.h

To use in your program, you must include parse.h and call the function
parse(), which return a Pipe data structure.  (See main.c)  The Pipe
contains all the information in a line of input to a shell.

===================

If there is a .ushrc, please place it in HOME.
Also, make sure the commands end with a new line character or ;
Most behavior of the ush is similar to that of csh.
